 * Chooses which market the editor is working on.

 * "All countries" edits the shared copy every market inherits. Picking a
 * country switches to editing that market's differences only — so a change to
 * something shared is still made once, in one place, rather than three times.
 *
 * The count next to a country is how many fields it currently overrides, which
 * answers the question an editor actually has: does this market differ, and by
 * how much?
