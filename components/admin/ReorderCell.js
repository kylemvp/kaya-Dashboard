 * Move-up / move-down controls for an ordered list.

 * Display order on the public site is the order of these rows, so reordering
 * is a real content decision — which treatments lead a category page, which
 * doctors appear first. Buttons rather than drag-and-drop: they work on touch
 * and with a keyboard without extra machinery.
 *
 * `collection` names the collection in AdminContext ('services', 'doctors', …)
 * and `index`/`total` come from the *unfiltered* list, so the arrows correctly
 * disable at the true ends rather than the ends of a filtered view.
